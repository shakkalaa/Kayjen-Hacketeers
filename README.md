# AT&T EmpowHer Hackathon - Kayjen Hacketeers 

## Introduction

### Inspiration
- ### What it does
   - Is your art application constantly crashing and lagging? Dynamic Sketch is an art application that uses AT&T’s 5G fiber internet services to allow a colorful experience without lag and decreased latency. It also provides a multi-mode that allows people to join servers and draw together on one canvas in real-time! Our team created an interactive website for consumer experience to learn about our product, Dynamic Sketch!
  
- ### How it was built
  - All of our team members have an interest in art, so we decided to combine technology with art and came up with Dynamic Sketch. Since a lot of focus is put on the consumers, we wanted to focus more on the creators, who are leading the future with their creativity. We first thought of Dynamic Sketch as a VR application; however, there were already similar innovations created before. So, we decided to add our own spin on an art application. Since we’re all familiar with art programs, we’ve had errors in the past with lagging and/or crashing while drawing on multiple layers of an app program. Dynamic Sketch is different in this aspect, because it uses AT&T’s 5G network to provide a smooth illustration experience and a multi-mode to connect with people across the world in real-time.

- ### Challenges
  - Some challenges that our team went through was determining what digital experience we wanted for the consumers. Initially, we were thinking of creating a game application; however, we later agreed on creating a website that was web and mobile friendly to promote Dynamic Sketch.
  - Another challenge was determining how Dynamic Sketch would generate revenue, while saving costs to create the application. Because creating multiple layers takes up a lot of storage and money, we had many difficulties thinking of ways we could reduce that cost.

- ### Accomplishments
  - Our biggest accomplishment is being able to work as an efficient team under time constraints.
  - Our next accomplishment was being able to fulfill research of AT&T’s 5G/fiber services, developing our own marketing strategies on the website, and to merge AT&T’s brand with Dynamic Sketch.

- ### What we've learned
  - The next important aspect that our team learned was trying to think from the perspective of all future parties involved in the making of Dynamic Sketch: artists, developers, marketers, and AT&T as a brand. AT&T’s mission statement is to enrich customer experience and to be speedy and I think Dynamic Sketch is an application that aligns with those core values in the mission statement. 
  - Our team learned a lot about customer experience and how AT&T’s 5G/fiber service would greatly be paired with Dynamic Sketch.
  - We learned a lot about AT&T’s 5G and fiber services while reading and watching AT&T’s resources. We learned about specific projects such as FirstNet and AT&T’s gaming VR collaboration with 100Thieves.

- ### Next steps in the project if continued
  - Built-in/live tutorials showcasing different features, created by diverse artists all over the world.
  - Cross platform progress and cloud saving
  - Drawing/Modeling with Virtual Reality– paid extension.
  - Paid subscription for premium features:
    - higher quality uploads/downloads
    - larger capacity channels for collaborating
    - more storage

## Key Frameworks
- JS: Javascript manipulates the DOM to fade in/fade out images and texts on scroll.
- HTML: HyperText Markup Language gives structure to our application.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets styles the application and makes use of the colors and fonts provided by AT&T.
  - Bootstrap.JS: Bootstrap is a key front-end framework that utilizes JS, HTML, and CSS to create a functional and internatve application.
